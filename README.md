# Data Visualization and Storytelling Project: NFL Kickoffs and Concussions

Using NFL Player, Game, and Concussion statistics, this project examines the evolution of the most exciting and dangerous play in the NFL: The Kickoff. The NFL has made changes to the kickoff rules three times since 2011, but the question remains: Have the rule changes since 2011 made the kickoff safer?

For a quick summary of the analysis, please check out the [infographic](https://github.com/DanZylkowski/Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling-Project/blob/main/5.3%20Project%20task%204%20DZylkowski%20Infographic.pdf) created for this project.
