    "NFL kickoff datasets used in this project were downloaded from [Stathead Football](https://stathead.com/football/play_finder.cgi). After downloading the yearly kickoff stats, I wanted to determine the percentage of normal kicks (i.e. kicks from the 35 yard-line) that did not reach the endzone (i.e. they were kicked less than 65 yards). To do this, I first filtered the Location column for rows containing 35, since those are normal kickoff spots. Next, I split the Detail string and kept everything to the left of the comma, and then filtered out everything but numbers, which gives the distance of the kick. Rows with missing/na Locations or Details were dropped. To calculate the percentage of normal kicks that didn't reach the endzone, I created a filter to cound the number of kicks less than 65 yards that were also kicked from the 35 yard line. Then I divided that number by the total number of normal kicks. These steps take place in the function below, and the percentage is returned when a dataframe is passed into the function. "
